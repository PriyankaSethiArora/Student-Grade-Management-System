# Student-Grade-Management-System
Build a simple console-based student grade management system that allows users (teachers) to:  Add new students with their grades Calculate the average grade of a student Find the highest and lowest-scoring students Save and load student records from a file.
Note: 
     1. Modularize the code by creating reusable functions for each operation.
     2. Use Python's built-in file handling (open(), read(), write()) or libraries like csv for saving and loading data.
     
Add a feature to remove a student

Implement letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on average scores.
